Please demonstrate Object association by creating at least two POJOs and a Controller class. The Controller
class will contain the main() method. In the main() create an object of each POJO you just created and associate
the two together. (This is easier than it sounds. Refer to the Object Association documentation if you're not sure.)

public class Book {
   String tittle;
    public Book(String tittle){
        this.tittle = tittle;
    }
}
public class Author {
    String name;
    public Author(String name){
        this.name = name;
    }
}
public class AuthorBookAssociation {
    Book b = new Book("Harry Potter");
    Person a = new Author("J.K Rowling");
    System.out.println(a.name + " wrote " + b.tittle);
}
